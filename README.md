# analytics-summit-wrap-ml-model
Demonstration repo for the 2021 Nashville Analytics Summit session "Get Your Model to Production Faster by Wrapping it in a Flask App"

There are currently three subdirectories in this repo:
* `flask-ml-api` is a bare bones Flask app that you could use as a starting point for wrapping your ML model in an API.
* `diabetes-predictor` is a working example of what a simple ML model might look like using `flask-ml-api` as a starting point.
* `live-demo` is the directory we'll start from for some live coding fun during the session; our goal will be to reproduce (more or less) what's in `diabetes-predictor`, discussing some of our choices and thinking along the way.
